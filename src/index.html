        <h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hi </h1>

        <p>I'm <a href="https://flamed.neocities.org/">fLaMEd</a> ðŸ”¥ and this is my homepage, website, digital garden, online scrapbook etc.</p>

        <p>After spending months messing around with the idea and concept for the new website locally on my computer I've decided to just get it up and work on it in public.</p>

        <p>I have an 88x31 button from 2000 that I am going to re-use. You can use this to link to flamed fury.</p>
