Plastic Hearts is the seventh studio album by American singer Miley Cyrus, released on November 27, 2020 via RCA Records. Plans to release three extended plays leading up to the release of the album were scrapped.

The disco-inspired “Midnight Sky” was released as the lead single from Plastic Hearts on August 14, 2020. Miley teamed up with British singer Dua Lipa on “Prisoner,” which was released on November 19, 2020, as the album’s second single.

In an 2019 interview, Miley has teased the mood and topics of her seventh studio album:

> I like to kind of just be genderless, I like feeling genre-less. [So this album will be] kind of a mosaic of all the things that I’ve been before.
