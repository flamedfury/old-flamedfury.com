Funny how I was thinking this week where 21 Savage has been lately. I was pleased to see a note on Genius that they had announced on the 29/09/20 that they are dropping Save Mode 2 on 02/10/2020!

That was then, this is now, and after a couple listens I ...

The opening track on savage mode was haunting. The speaker crackle through out the track and the classic 21 ad-libs I knew I was in for a good time.

### Most frequent adlibs
21, pussy, straight up.

### My fav tracks
runnin, glock in my lap, many men, my dawg
