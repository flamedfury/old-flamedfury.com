Wasn't expecting this project as when we last heard from Conway on the Joe Budden podcast he was talking about God Donâ€™t Make Mistakes, so this was a suprise.

This is the second collaboration project with [BigGhost](https://bigghostlimited.bandcamp.com/). 

Have given this album a few listens and it's pretty good. The standout tracks for me are [Kill All Rats](https://bigghostlimited.bandcamp.com/track/kill-all-rats-ft-ransom-rome-streetz) and [Red Beams](https://bigghostlimited.bandcamp.com/track/red-beams).

[Go support and buy the project on Bandcamp](https://bigghostlimited.bandcamp.com/album/if-it-bleeds-it-can-be-killed).
