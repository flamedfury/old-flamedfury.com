5 episodes into this amazing television show and I can't wait to see how it ends up. 

Super stoked to see "the snap" being referenced, and glad to have figured out that Wanda's doing this by herself rather than being manipulated by Hydra or another bad actor. But also sad that she's so grief stricken that it has led her to this.

Hilarious that the X-Men version of Pietro, Quicksilver showed up.

Will add more as the series progresses.
